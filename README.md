## Local agentic workflow examples 🤖

| Name | What's that? |  |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **invoice-parser** | A Python CLI that extracts structured data from bill pictures using a 2-step agentic workflow | [▶️ Go to the code](./examples/invoice-parser/) |
| **audio-transcription-cli** | A Python CLI for real-time audio-to-text transcription using LFM2-Audio-1.5B with llama.cpp | [▶️ Go to the code](./examples/audio-transcription-cli/) |



## Fine-Tune an LFM2 model 🎯

### LFM2 (Text-to-text)

LFM2 is a generation of hybrid models, designed for on-device deployment, ranging from 350M up to 8B parameters.

These models are particularly suited for agentic tasks, data extraction, RAG, creative writing, and multi-turn conversations. We do not recommend using them for tasks that are knowledge-intensive or require programming skills.

## Deploy to an edge device 📱

The [LEAP Edge SDK](https://leap.liquid.ai/docs/edge-sdk/overview) is our native framework for running LFM2 models on mobile devices.

Written for Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift), the goal of the Edge SDK is to make Small Language Model deployment as easy as calling a cloud LLM API endpoint, for any app developer.
